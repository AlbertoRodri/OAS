      summary: Retrieves the account list of a Santander customer.
      description: >-
        Retrieves a list of current, savings, and credit accounts of a customer.
        This operation is available to Santander staff, in addition to physical
        and business customers.


        To use this operation:

        - With physical customers, the 'Document-Type' and 'Document-Number' parameters are not needed.

        - With representatives of business customers, the 'Document-Type' and 'Document-Number' parameters can be used to identify the company whose information is going to be retrieved.

        - With all customers, if the customer has a channel access agreement, the 'Channel-Access-Agreement-Id' parameter can be used to restrict the retrieved information only to data that the channel access agreement authorises the logged-in person to access.

        - With Santander staff, the 'Document-Number' or 'customer_id' parameter is required to identify the customer whose data they are authorized to access.
      parameters:
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/X-B3-TraceId"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/X-B3-ParentSpanId"
        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/X-B3-SpanId"

        - name: Document-Type
          required: false
          in: header
          description: >-
            Type of the official identification document that has been used in
            the bank to uniquely and legally identify the customer.


            The possible values are:

            - national_id_card

            - foreign_resident_id_card

            - driving_license_number

            - tax_id


            The document type depends on the customer type (for example, only 'tax_id' is applicable for a business customer). 
          example: tax_id
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: Document-Number
          required: false
          in: header

            Identification document number.


            The value is country-dependent.


            If the 'Document-Type' parameter is provided, this parameter is mandatory, and the retrieved account must be linked to the customer identified by the document. 


            In case of a business customer, the company identification can also be included in this value, and the accounts are retrieved only if the logged-in company representative is authorized to access the company accounts.
          example: "B86561412 "
          schema:

          required: false

          description: >-
            Channel access agreement ID.


            If a value is provided for this parameter, the requested data is retrieved only if the defined channel access agreement authorises the logged-in person to access that data.
          example: "004910015200000090"

          in: query
          description: >-
            Number of pages to be omitted from the beginning of the response.


            The number of rows on each omitted page is determined by the '_limit' parameter.


            The default value is 0, in which case the first page is shown.
          example: "1"
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: _limit
          required: false
          in: query
          description: |-
            Maximum number of rows to be included on each page in the response.

            Fewer rows can be returned, if the query does not yield that many.

            The default value is 5.
          example: "3"
          schema:
            type: string

          in: query

          in: query
          description: >-
            Status of the accounts to be included in the response.


            The possible values are:

            - Open = Account is open and movements are restricted only by the customer's available balance and account contract attributes. This includes accounts with warnings.

            - Closed = Account is closed.

            - Pending Closure = Account is being closed.

            - Open with Severe Lock = Account is open but there is a lock on some or all account movements.

            The maximum number of included accounts is 20. If you want data about more than 20 accounts, call the API multiple times, for 20 accounts at a time.

            The possible values are:

            - IBA = IBAN code

            - BBA = Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) that represents a country-specific bank account number. Each country has its own standards for the format and length of the BBAN. The value is at most 31 char or 35 bytes long.

            - In UK, the BBAN is: Sortcode(6) + Account(8)

            - In Spain, it is: Banco(4) + Sucursal(4) + CD(2) + CTA(10)


            The default value is BBA.

      summary: Retrieves the account transaction list of a Santander customer.
      description: >-
        Retrieves a list of transactions for a specific savings, current, or
        credit account. This operation is available to Santander staff, in
        addition to physical and business customers.


        To send this request, you must provide an account number in the request path.  The number uses the BBAN format by default. To use another format, define the format in the 'account_id_type' parameter.


        The transactions included in the response can be filtered by a time period (start and end dates), transaction type, currency, and amount. You can also sort them in descending or ascending order by date.


        The maximum available time period depends on the local bank.

        To send this request, you must provide an account number in the request path. The number uses the BBAN format by default. To use another format, define the format in the 'account_id_type' parameter.


        When an account credit movement is expected, but not yet booked, a limit can be used to temporarily approve a specific overdraft limit for the account.


        The created limit has an impact on the overdraft limit of the account, and consequently also on the available balance. The limit is removed:

        - When the limit amount is booked on the account using a matching limit ID

        - Automatically after its validity period ends

            BBA: BBAN is the English acronym for Basic Bank Account code. Represents a country-specific bank account number. Each country has its format and length of BBAN depending on its own standards. Currently there is no common standard that unifies the format of BBAN in the EU or other entities. This is why the IBAN appeared to help standardize international bank transfers. BBAN CODE.Nationals accounts format of the a country. Maximum long  31 char of all 35 bytes of the field. For exemple: In UK Sortcode(6) + Account(8); In ES Banco(4)+ Sucursal(4) + CD(2) + CTA(10).

        Sampling is a mechanism to reduce the volume of data in the tracing system. In B3, sampling applies consistently per-trace: once the sampling decision is made, the same value must be consistently sent downstream. This means that either all or no spans share a trace ID.
